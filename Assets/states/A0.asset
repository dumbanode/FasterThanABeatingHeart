  storyText: "\"Oh no! I'm late!\"\r\n\r\nI exclaim as I dash out of my parent's basement
    with a thick piece of waffle hanging out of my drooling mouth.\r\n\r\nHi, my name
    is Kevin, I am a 30 year old university student and I am in love with Sonic the
    Hedgehog. I have never met him before, but I know everything there is to know
    about him. I own all of his video games, every single comic book, all his merchandise,
    all the soundtracks on vinyl, even his replica shoes!\r\n\r\nDid you know that
    Sonic the Hedgehog's middle name is Maurice? I know this because I am his number
    one fan!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I was up late last night playing Sonic Forces and
    slept in too late. I am now late for Mr. Walsh's embedded systems course, and
    if I'm late again he's going to fail me!\r\n\r\nThere's a shortcut ahead! Take
    it?\r\n\r"
