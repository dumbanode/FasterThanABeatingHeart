  storyText: "\"Hey Sonic! Wait up! You know I can't run as fast as you!\" I yell
    out into the hallway before he speeds off.\r\n\r\nSonic, not turning out, replies
    in a muddled voice. \"Going to make fun of me some more are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.
    I just want to tell you something that I should have told you before, but I didn't
    have the courage.\"\r\n\r\nSonic turns around, and is surprised by who he sees.\r\n\r\n\"It's
    you! The one in the hallway! Why did you run away?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was embarrassed.
    I didn't know what to say to you!\"\r\n\r\nSonic smirks. \"You know, running away
    is pointless because you can never outrun me. I'm the world's fastest hedgehog,
    I'm Sonic the Hedgehog!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are! Your average speed is around 700mph!\"\r\n\r\nSonic
    is taken back. \"!... How did you know that!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am the world's number
    one Sonic the Hedgehog fan! I wanted to tell you how much of an inspiration you
    are to me! You mean so much to me, ever since I was a kid! I....\" I stop myself.
    No, I can't say that! I'll scare him off!\r\n\r\nSonic the Hedgehog pauses for
    a second, closes his eyes and smiles. \"Huh, number one fan eh? That's a bold
    claim you got there! How do I know you're the real deal?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, I
    may be just 'another' rabid fan that you have to put up with every single day,
    and it may be true. But what I do know, is that you didn't deserve what happened
    to you in that lecture hall. They see you as nothing more than a meme in there,
    but that isn't true. You are so much more, don't let them get to you like that.\"\r\n\r\nA
    brief pause flies by again, and I see a genuine smile show up on Sonic's face.
    \"Thanks kid, I really needed that.\" He scribbles something down on a slip of
    paper, and hands it to me. \"If you ever have any free time, don't be afraid to
    give me a shout. I gotta get back to kick'n some Eggbutt, gotta jet!\"\r\n\r\nIn
    a blink of an eye, Sonic is gone. I look down to the slip of paper he handed me
    and slowly  unfolded it.\r\n\r\nIt's...IT'S SONIC'S PHONE NUMBER! OH MY GOD I
    CAN NOT BELIEVE IT! THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE!\r\n\r\nAs I continue silently
    freaking out, the janitor walks by and notices Sonic's shoe smudges on the floor.\r\n\r\n\"
    MY FLOORS!\" \r\n"
