    eyes and say, 'Way to go Knucklehead!'\"\r\n\r\nWe both laugh loudly, drowning
    out the sound of chatter throughout the lively diner. It's been a few hours, but
    it only feels like a few minutes. Sonic and I are gelling together like gel and
    gel. This has to be my 4th chili dog by now. Honestly, I've lost count. \r\nThose
    chili dogs are really getting to my head now, I can't think straight, that was
    some potent chili. It's difficult to keep track of anything right now. All I can
    keep track on right now is Sonic, nothing else can capture my attention."
