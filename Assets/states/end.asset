    I hope you had fun reading through this gripping story of love and passion! Unfortunately,
    the scope of this project quickly ballooned out of control, so I''m currently
    putting this on the back burner. Perhaps I will return to this in the future,
    but as of right now, there are more important projects I would prefer to work
    on.


    And with that, I wish you all a good day, and to stop procrastionating. '
