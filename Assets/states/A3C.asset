    Ohmygod Ohmygod Ohmygod Ohmygod Ohmygod Ohmygod Ohmygod!\r\n\r\nIt's him! It's
    Sonic the Hedgehog! Right in front of me! In the flesh! \r\n\r\n\"Sorry about
    that bud, are you okay?\" He asks me as he recovers off the floor.\r\n\r\nMy brain
    is stalling. So many thoughts are rushing through my head right now, causing myself
    to short circuit. There he is, right in front of me, yet the only thoughts manifesting
    in my head are about the hue of his blue. I have seen Sonic in so many mediums;
    cartoon, game, print, yet seeing the hue of his blue in person is unlike anything
    I have ever seen.  Television screens and ink can not convey how deep and rich
    his blue truly is. Sonic truly stands out confidently among these drab, lifeless
    walls. \r\n\r\nThe definition of his spines are something you have to see in real
    life. Polygons cannot do it justice. The way they protrude from behind him are
    so elegant, yet so mathematically organized. It's almost like god herself crafted
    them to be the perfect form, without losing the naturalistic flow.\r\n\r\nOceans
    of white, stretching for miles. Traveling without need for despair, and I slowly
    reach the green fields of his irises...He's looking right at me.\r\n\r\nUhh..
    How long have I been staring at him? I need to say something!\r\n\r\n\"Uh...\"
    And I ran, without second thought. I was scared. I met my hero, someone I idolized
    since I could first hold a chunky SEGA Genesis control. It was embarrassing, standing
    there not saying anything for god knows how long?!? I had no other choice. This
    is one of the worst days of my life! \r\n\r\n "
