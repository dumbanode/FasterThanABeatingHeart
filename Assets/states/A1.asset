  storyText: "You made it just in time, but unfortunately someone is sitting in your
    unassigned assigned seat at the back of the class.\r\n\r\n\"Oh great, now I have
    to sit at the front. I don't want Mr. Walsh to smell my unbelievable body odour.\"\r\n\r\nYou
    sucked it up and parked your ass in the front of the class room. Mr. Walsh started
    the lecture and gave a lesson on time scheduling. \r\n\r\n\"Booooorrriinnnggg,
    I don't want to learn about how a computer works! All I want to do is learn how
    to make video games!\" You thought to yourself while rolling your eyes. You grab
    your Intendo Snitch and load up Sonic Mania. \"Wow this game is fast!\" You almost
    say outload.\r\n\r\n\"Now class, tomorrow we have a very special guest. I am pleasured
    to announce that Sonic the Hedgehog will be a guest speaker during tomorrow's
    lecture, so I ask you all to be on your best behaviour as our university doesn't
    get many high profile guests like Sonic the Hedgehog around very often\"\r\n\r\nYour
    ears perk up and you drop your Snitch. Sonic the Hedgehog! In the flesh! Unbelievable!
    I can't believe this is happening! Have I died and gone to heaven!?!?\r\n\r\n\"Excuse
    me Mr.Walsh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes Kevin\"\r\n\r\n\"What shoes will Sonic be wearing?
    Is it his classic shoes or his SOAP shoes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, now class
    if you observe-\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Walsh! Where is Sonic travelling from? Is he coming
    from South Island? Or is it Station Square? Or is he coming from-\"\r\n\r\n\"Kevin,
    I don't know okay, now if I can just-\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Walsh! Do you think Sonic
    is going to explain to us about what happen that one time when the moon was blown
    up in Sonic Adventure 2 but the moon was back to normal in Shadow the Hedgehog,
    which is technically a sequel to Sonic Adventure 2? Also why didn't GUN help out
    in Sonic Forces? Is it because it took place on a different planet as supported
    by the two world continuity-\"\r\n\r\n\"Kevin! How about you go home early and
    prepare for his visit? I'm sure you aren't going to be missing much by leaving
    early?\"\r\n\r\nYour eyes glow. \"Wow thanks Mr. Walsh! I hope Sonic likes Axe
    body spray!\"\r\n\r\nYou scurry on home."
