  storyText: "Ugh, I can't believe I stayed up until 4am playing Sonic Forces! I just
    had to customize my original character just right! My character is a hedgehog
    (obviously) who looks just like Sonic, but he wears a GAMER hat. \r\n\r\nAt least
    I arrived on time today, and with some time to kill as well. I put on some extra
    body spray to cover the fact that I hate showers. My class starts at 10:30am,
    and I arrived at 9:30am. I have one whole hour to play Sonic Mania on my Snitch
    and practice my speedruns! Just me, Sonic and my large cup of coffee to tide me
    over.\r\n\r\nUgh... maybe that coffee wasn't the best idea. I need to use the
    washroom....NOW!"
