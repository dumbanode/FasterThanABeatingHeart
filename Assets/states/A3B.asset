    thud! I see someone heading into the last available stall.\r\n\r\n\"Not today
    chump!\"\r\n\r\nI body check them right into the wall, and they fall to the ground
    in a big explosion of notebooks and pencils. Blood, dripping down their nose,
    they try to wipe it clean but can't seem to move the arm that cushioned they're
    impact. They crawl along the ground, calling out for some help, but nobody is
    around. \r\n\r\n\"Ah, that's much better.\" I tell myself, making sure not to
    trip on what looks like a corpse on the floor. I turn the corner, and find myself
    bumping into a short man. \r\n\r\n\"Hey! Watch were you are going-\" I'm interrupted
    by my own astonishment of who I bumped into....."
