  storyText: "\nMy heart is still beating after what happened. I have Sonic the Hedgehog's
    phone number, right here, in the palm of my hands! This has to be a dream right
    now! But now, the question is... when do I call him? I've never been in a situation
    like this before? I would ask my friends, but unfortunately I do not have any!
    Ugh, this is so stressful! How do people do this!\r\n\r\n\"I should think this
    over.\"\r\n\r\nI place the slip of paper on my desk, when suddenly a gust of wind
    sucks it right out the window! I almost shrieked!\r\n\r\n\"Oh my god NO!\" I burst

    starts and the driver starts driving away. \"NO! PLEASE STOP!\"\r\n\r\nI look
    forward and watch the truck disappear into the distance. My heart is broken. My
    one chance, gone! \"Damn, well... that's what I deserve for getting my hopes up.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly,
    I notice the truck taking a sharp turn and stopping off at a chili dog restaurant
