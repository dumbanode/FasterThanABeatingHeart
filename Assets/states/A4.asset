  storyText: "I built up my courage and returned to class. I can't believe how ashamed
    I am of myself for what just happened. Regardless, I can't be late for another
    class. I'll just sit in the back of the classroom and hopefully Sonic the Hedgehog
    won't notice me.\r\n\r\nOh great! That jerk from yesterday is sitting in my spot
    again! And the only spot available is....\r\n\r\nin the front of the classroom.....\r\n\r\nPull
    yourself together! I can manage this! It's only a 3 hour lecture! It'll be over
    before I know it!\r\n\r\nMr. Walsh starts the lecture and wholeheartedly welcomes
    Sonic the Hedgehog to the front of the room. If I wasn't so embarrassed, I'd be
    clapping. Hopefully my classmates will give him the warm welcome he deserves...\r\n\r\nSonic
    walks to the front of the lecture hall, and the class... starts booing him?!?\r\n\r\n\"Hey
    SANIC! Where's your chili dog!\"\r\n\r\n\"GOTTA GO FAST! FREAK!\"\r\n\r\n\"AY!
    Remember SONIC 06!\"\r\n\r\nOne by one, the students are throwing insults at him,
    each worse than the last. Sonic just stands there, looking bewildered. He turns
    to Mr. Walsh, who does not look impressed at the class right now.\r\n\r\n\"Hey,
    maybe I should just...leave?\" Sonic says to him.\r\n\r\nHe turns around and leaves
    the way he came, all while the class does not let up.\r\n\r\n\"That's right! Why
    not star in a good game! Like Super Mario Odyssey!\" One of them adds.\r\n\r\nPoor
    Sonic, he must have traveled from so far away to be here right now. He must be
    so upset. Screw these kids, I don't think Sonic is lame! I'm going to go after
    him and tell him how I feel!"
